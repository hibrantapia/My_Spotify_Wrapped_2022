1. I downloaded the graphics and save them from 1 - 9, so you can see them at a glance.
2. I made an infographic about this project, make sure to check out the PDF file.
3. This is the data I requested from Spotify and merged into just one .json file.
4. I put all the resources and references on a .txt file, make sure to check out the autors.
5. This is the .R project, where all the magic happens, hope it's usefull to you.
